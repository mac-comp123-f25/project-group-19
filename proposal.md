## Description

We are going to make an assignment/activity tracker. The user will be able to add assignments, provide due dates for them, and mark them as completed. This might function somewhat similarly to Google Calendar task notifications.


## Inspirations Behind

We all selected 'productivity' as something we would be down to work on. We chose this specific task because it seemed like a challenging but achievable task and also because it's something that we can picture each of ourselves using in our everyday life.
